  <p><i>ROS integration for the Waveshare JeTank AI Kit with autonomous sock collection functionality</i></p>
</div>

## 🤖 Project Overview

This repository provides a complete Robot Operating System (ROS) integration for the [Waveshare JeTank AI Kit](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/JETANK_AI_Kit), transforming it into a fully autonomous robot platform. Building upon the [original Waveshare JeTank repository](https://github.com/waveshare/JETANK), this project adds ROS2 compatibility and extends the robot's capabilities to include autonomous sock detection and collection in indoor environments.

**This is all work in progress!**

For recent development logs and notes, see the [Updates](#updates) section.

## 🛠️ Hardware updates

- **Camera module**: Updated the stock IMX219-160 Camera module to a IMX219-83 Stereo Camera module to allow for depth perception
- **Computation module**: The basic jetank is made for a Jetson nano developer B01, But I want to upgrade it to the new Orin Jetson super developer kit

## ✨ Key Features

- **Complete ROS Integration**: Full conversion of the JeTank platform to ROS architecture
- **ROS Control Package**: Comprehensive drivers for all JeTank hardware:
  - Motor control interface
  - Camera integration
  - Servo controllers
  - Sensor data publishing
- **Autonomous Navigation**: SLAM-based mapping and path planning
- **Computer Vision Pipeline**: Object detection system for sock identification
- **Custom Gripper Mechanism**: Design files for sock collection attachment

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

- **ROS Melodic**: Full node architecture with publishers/subscribers
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**: Optimized for the B01 Developer Kit
- **Python**: Clean, modular codebase for hardware interfacing
- **C++**: Performance-critical components
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite integration
- **SLAM**: Implementation for autonomous navigation
- **Hardware Integration**: Bridging Jetson Nano with ROS ecosystem

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 🎯 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Hardware Abstraction Layer
**Solution**: Created modular drivers that abstract the JeTank hardware details, making them accessible through standard ROS interfaces.

### Challenge 2: Resource Constraints on Jetson Orin Nano
**Solution**: Optimized code for the Jetson Nano's ARM architecture and 8GB memory, prioritizing efficient algorithms and parallel processing where possible.

### Challenge 3: ROS2 Humble Compatibility
**Solution**: Ensured all packages and dependencies are compatible with ROS2 Humble and the Ubuntu 22 environment on the Jetson Nano.

## 👨‍💻 About the Developer

This project aims to get more experience in robotics software integration, ROS architecture, Computer vision, and practical autonomous systems. By transforming a consumer robot kit into a fully ROS-compatible platform with advanced capabilities, I hope to increase my ability to bridge hardware and software in complex robotic systems, particularly on resource-constrained embedded platforms like the Jetson Nano.
